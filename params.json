Preheat oven to 450 degrees with a nonstick popover pan on the lowest rack. (A standard muffin tin is fin, but popovers will\r\n   be smaller and may not rise as well.)\r\n2. Measure flour and salt and set aside.\r\n3. Whisk eggs and milk for about 1 minute until frothy.\r\n4. Add flour and salt into egg mixture. Whisk by hand until the batter is the consistency of heavy cream. Any small lumps remaining   \r\n   are ok. Air bubbles are a good thing!        \r\n5. Remove the popover pan from the oven and coat with cooking spray.\r\n6. Fill the popover cups about 3/4 full. Sprinkle the asiago cheese evenly over the popovers.\r\n7. Bake for 20 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees and continue to bake for about 20 minutes more,   \r\n   until the popovers are golden brown and dry to the touch.\r\n8. Turn popovers out onto a cooling rack and make a small opening in the side of each one to let steam escape. Serve immediately.\r\n\r\n \r\n",
